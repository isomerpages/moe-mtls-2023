<span style="font-color:black; font-align:center; font-size:36px;"><strong>EXHIBITION BOOTHS &amp; CENTREPIECE</strong></span>

<p>This year's symposium will feature 42 physical exhibition booths from schools and community partners with fun and interactive activities. Children can look forward to taking part in the MTL challenge by participating in Mother Tongue Language activities at all of the exhibition booths to collect stamps and redeem prizes.<br>
There will also be the MOE Curriculum Booth, which will feature information from preschool to junior college. Visitors will learn about the progression in curricula and key programmes in the educational journey.<br>
